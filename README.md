# Reinforcement Learning Techniques with R [Video]
This is the code repository for [Reinforcement Learning Techniques with R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/reinforcement-learning-techniques-r-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788390705), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning that allows machines and software agents to act smart and automatically detect the ideal behavior within a specific environment, in order to maximize its performance and productivity. Reinforcement Learning is becoming popular because it not only serves as an way to study how machine and software agents learn to act, it is also been used as a tool for constructing autonomous systems that improve themselves with experience. This video will give you a brief introduction to Reinforcement Learning; it will help you navigate the "Grid world" to calculate likely successful outcomes using the popular MDPToolbox package. This video will show you how the Stimulus - Action - Reward algorithm works in Reinforcement Learning. By the end of this video you will have a basic understanding of the concept of reinforcement learning, you will have compiled your first Reinforcement Learning program, and will have mastered programming the environment for Reinforcement Learning.
